# ASR - Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic Speech Recognition using neural networks. This repo contains implementations of NVIDIA's Jasper and QuartzNet speech
recognition architectures. Their approach doesn't rely on RNNs like most do, but rather opts for a fully 
convolutional approach.
**NOTE**: you'll have to unzip the **ffmpeg** binaries manually because we had to push them as zip archives due to Git LFS bandwith limitations. Just do *Extract Here* in their appropriate directories.

The research papers can be found on Arxiv:
 - [Jasper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03288.pdf)
 - [QuartzNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10261.pdf)
